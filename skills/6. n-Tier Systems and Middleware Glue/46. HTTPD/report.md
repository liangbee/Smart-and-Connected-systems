Assignment Number: 46
Title: HTTPD
Teammate: None
Content:
I followed the guide on whizzer.bu.edu to complete this skill. 
The esp32 code currently sends HTTP post requests correctly to the node server, but the node server cannot display it correctly, nor can the esp32 receive http request from the node server.
The html website is made.
Below is a screenshot of the terminal output saying http post reuqest was successfuly and a picture of the wireup of the ECP32.
