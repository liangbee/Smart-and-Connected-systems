Title: Raspberry pi
Teammate: None
Content:
I followed the guide on whizzer.bu.edu to complete this skill. 

I first made sure that my computer is on the same network as my raspberry pi.
Then, I sshed to my raspberry pi and used the command node app.js to start my node server.
In my own computer's browser, I typed in the ip of the pi at port 3000. 
An example hello world site is displayed in the browser.
The evidence screenshot is included below.
