Assignment Number: 39
Title: RTOS
Teammate: None
Content:
I followed the guide on whizzer.bu.edu to complete this skill. 

I first wired up the thermistor and the leds. Then I created 3 tasks to
1) collect sampling data from the thermistor every 100ms and store them in a buffer.
2) take the average of the readings and compare it with the previous average reading.
3) Set led status to reflect the result from task 2).

Evidence videos and a picture of the wireout are included below.
One video prints out only the led status and the other one prints out both led status and average readings for convinience.
