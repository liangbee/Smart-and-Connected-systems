Title:Flash Storage
Teammate: None
Content:

I followed the tutorial on whizzer.bu.edu to make a nvm implementation of the flash storage task.
How to interact with the code:
the first character you enter is the index of the string you wish to WRITE.
then you enter 10 characters that represents that string.
At the end you enter the index of the string you wish to READ.
the string will be printed in terminal.
If no changes wished to be made, enter a character that is not 0-7 as the first character and type in 10 random characters. Then enter the index of the desired read string.
