Assignment Number: 13
Title:Use stopwatch
Teammate: None
Content:
In the stopwatch skill, I was able to implement the gpio tasks to count the press from button and print it out in console, which means the interrupt handler works fine. However it would not start my timer module and interact with 
other components.
