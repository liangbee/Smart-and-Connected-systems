Assignment Number: 27
Title: Wheel Speed
Teammate: None
Content:
I followed the instruction on whizzer.bu.edu to build the wheel speed monitor.
Since the quality of the optical encoder is bad, the average speed calculated from the code 
does not fluctuate much, but the voltage monitored was changing as normal.
The feature to calculate speed is also implemented. I put in the circumference of the wheel
and painted it half white half black. When the optical encoder catches the change in color, 
it registers the rise/fall edge of the voltage and do a simple distance divided by time to find
out the average speed. The encoder itself however is not very good at catching the change fast enough,
thus slow speed is outputed.
